# User Authentication

The `createUser` and `signinUser` mutations that provide you with a way to create and sign in users respectively depend on your enabled [auth providers](!alias-seimeish6e#authentication-providers). You can enable multiple or just one auth provider, however you can only use one auth provider per user.

As any other `create` mutation, `createUser` returns the newly created `User` node.

For Email and Digits, the `signinUser` mutation returns a [temporary authentication token](!alias-wejileech9) that can be used to authenticate the user in further queries or mutations. For Auth0, you can use the same token for creating a new user and authenticating a request.

## Permission setup

Auth providers need an appropriate [permission setup](!alias-geekae9gah) to work correctly.

## Email and Password

**Creating a User**

To create a new user with email and password, enable the built-in email and password auth provider, and provide an `email` and `password` to the `createUser` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: {
    authProvider: {
      email: {
        email: "user@email.com"
        password: "secret-password"
      }
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }) {
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Signing in a User**

To sign in an existing user with email and password, provide his `email` and `password` to the `signinUser` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  signinUser(input: {
    email: {
      email: "user@email.com"
      password: "secret-password"
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }) {
    token
  }
}
```

Now you can use the obtained token in your header when making requests to [authenticate the request](!alias-wejileech9).
The token has an expiration duration of 30 days.

## Digits Phone Verification

If you want to enable Digits Phone Verification to authenticate your users, you need to provide your Digits consumer key and consumer secret in the Auth provider configuration dialog.

**Creating a User**

To create a new user with Digits, provide the `apiUrl` and `credentials` tokens that were assigned to your application from Digits to the `createUser` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: {
    authProvider: {
      digits: {
        apiUrl: "<apiUrl>"
        credentials: "<credentials>"
      }
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }) {
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Signing in a User**

To sign in an existing user with Digits, provide his `apiUrl` and `credentials` to the `signinUser` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  signinUser(input: {
    digits: {
      apiUrl: "<apiUrl>"
      credentials: "<credentials>"
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }) {
    token
  }
}
```

Now you can use the obtained token in your header when making requests to [authenticate the request](!alias-wejileech9).
The token has an expiration duration of 30 days.

## Auth0 Social Logins

If you want to enable Auth0 Social Logins to authenticate your users, you need to provide your Auth0 id in the Auth provider configuration dialog.

**Creating a User**

To create a new user provide the `idToken` token obtained from Auth0:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: {
    authProvider: {
      auth0: {
        idToken: "<idToken>"
      }
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }) {
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Signing in a User**

No special step is needed to obtain a token for Auth0. You can use the same `idToken` to [authenticate a request](!alias-wejileech9) that you would use for the `createUser` mutation. You can configure the expiration duration of these tokens in the settings of your Auth0 account.

## Create User and Sign in afterwards

You might want to create a user and sign him in right afterwards. You can include both the `createUser` mutation and the `signinUser` mutation in the same request:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: {
    authProvider: {
      email:{
        email: "user@email.com"
        password: "secret-password"
        }
      }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }){
    id
  }
  signinUser(input: {
    email: {
      email: "user@email.com"
      password: "secret-password"
    }
    clientMutationId: "abc"
  }){
    token
  }
}
```

This works because multiple mutations included in the same request are being run sequentially.
If you want to create a user with credentials that already exist, an error is returned from the API. You can catch this error and prompt your user to sign in instead.
